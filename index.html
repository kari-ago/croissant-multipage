        <h1>The History of the <em>Croissant</em> </h1>
        
        <p>
            Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiseries, are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
            <br>
            Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries.

            Is the Croissant Really French?
        </h2>
        <p>
            A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin, but mostly associated with France.
            Experts do agree that the croissant was inspired by the Austrian kipfel, a crescent-shaped baked good featuring a generous amount of butter or lard and sometimes sugar and almonds. According to popular lore, the kipfel originated in 1683 as a comestible celebration of Austrian victory over the Ottomans at the siege of Vienna.

            <br>
            Legend credits the French queen Marie Antoinette—homesick for a taste of her native Vienna—with introducing the kipfel, and thus the croissant, to France. But Chevallier sees no evidence to support this notion.
